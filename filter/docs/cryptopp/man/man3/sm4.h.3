Classes for the \fBSM4\fP block cipher\&.

\fBSM4\fP is a block cipher designed by Xiaoyun Wang, et al\&. The block cipher is part of the Chinese State Cryptography Administration portfolio\&. The cipher was formerly known as SMS4\&.

.PP
\fBSM4\fP encryption is accelerated on machines with AES-NI\&. Decryption is not accelerated because it is not profitable\&. Thanks to Markku-Juhani Olavi Saarinen for help and the code\&.
