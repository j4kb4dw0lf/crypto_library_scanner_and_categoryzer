.SH "Supported Versions"
.PP
We support modern versions of the Crypto++ library\&. Modern versions include the tip of Master and the latest release\&.

.PP
We also support versions of the library supplied by distributions such as Debian, Fedora, Red Hat and Ubuntu\&. We don't leave distros unsupported simply because we have released a new version of the library\&. And we don't expect a package maintainer to fix our bugs for us\&.
.SH "Reporting a Vulnerability"
.PP
You can report a security related bug in the \fRGitHub bug tracker\fP or at the \fRmailing list\fP\&.

.PP
If we receive a report of a security related bug then we will ensure a Github issue is opened and we will make an announcement on the mailing list\&. If you corresponded by private email then we will open the Github issue and make the announcement\&.

.PP
All information will be made public\&. We do not withhold information from users because stake holders need accurate information to access risk and place controls to remediate the risk\&.
