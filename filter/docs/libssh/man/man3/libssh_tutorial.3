.SH "Introduction"
.PP
libssh is a C library that enables you to write a program that uses the SSH protocol\&. With it, you can remotely execute programs, transfer files, or use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs\&. The SSH protocol is encrypted, ensures data integrity, and provides strong means of authenticating both the server of the client\&. The library hides a lot of technical details from the SSH protocol, but this does not mean that you should not try to know about and understand these details\&.

.PP
libssh is a Free Software / Open Source project\&. The libssh library is distributed under LGPL license\&. The libssh project has nothing to do with "libssh2", which is a completely different and independent project\&.

.PP
libssh can run on top of either libcrypto, mbedtls or libgcrypt (deprecated) general-purpose cryptographic libraries\&.

.PP
This tutorial concentrates for its main part on the "client" side of libssh\&. To learn how to accept incoming SSH connections (how to write a SSH server), you'll have to jump to the end of this document\&.

.PP
This tutorial describes libssh version 0\&.5\&.0\&. This version is a little different from the 0\&.4\&.X series\&. However, the examples should work with little changes on versions like 0\&.4\&.2 and later\&.
